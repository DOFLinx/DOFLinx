This folder contains a series of sample INI files for use with DOFLinx.  You *** WILL *** need to customise your INI file for use on your system.

Remember to read the guide provided for full details on INI files and the setting contained within them.  This little readme explaining the files is not a substitute for the guide.

There are two types of INI files for use with DOFLinx.
1. DOFLinx.INI, this file is your base configuration and is by default in the same directory as the DOFLinx.EXE.
   With the addition of a command line parameter it can be located anywhere.
   This INI file contains all of the essential stuff to get DOFLinx to start up.
   There is only one of these files per setup.

2. Sup.INI, well in fact anyname.INI
   You can have multiple 'supplimentary' INI files that alter DOFLinx behaviour while its running.
   They are normally used with 'Launch before' and / or 'Launch after' options from your front end menu (ie PinballX) to setup something specific like a fixed game name, turning on certain button lights, etc.
   There can be multiple supplimentary INI files within your setup.

In this folder the samples will all start with "DOFLinx" or "Sup" corresponding to the two types above.  They then have a "-explanation" to explain the sample being provided.
Remove the "-explaination" if you decide to copy one of these files and modifiy it to be your own.

INI files can have comments, in fact, with a memory like mine I highly recommend them.  Comment lines start with a #
In some sample files some parameters are there but commented out with the # symbol.  If you want to use that line, just edit out the #

Most importantly, have fun, and head over to VPForums.org for the DOFLinx support forums.

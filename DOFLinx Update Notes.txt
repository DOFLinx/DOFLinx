- FX files for all basic Pinball FX items - bumpers, flippers, slings
- Specific FX files for Indiana Jones, Addams Family, Sorcerer's Lair, Wild West Rampage
- Add a new right click test option to test by device name, ie "Left Flipper", "Right Slingshot", etc.  This will test all ports associated with that device which is handy when you have mutltiple toys linked to the same logical device or are simply chasing some wierd arse fault.
- New FF_PROC as a new action type.  This can be used to start a background process from an event.  Usage is FF_PROC Command,Argument, ie FF_PROC SomeBatch.bat,Data
  If you use this do so carefully, you could spawn a lot of processes quickly and that can bog your machine down
  This was requested by some people trying to do tricky stuff on their cabinet.
- New add command line parameter EDIT_INI=YES to force DOFLinx to go straight to the DOFLinx.INI parameter editor
- New DOFLinx.INI parameter PATH_HI2TXT= .  This is the path where Hi2Txt utility for getting MAME high scores has been placed. I'm using C:\Hi2Txt\ . Leave it out or blank if you don't have / want this.
- Add a new right click test option for Pixelcade devices and MAME high scores
- Add COLOUR_FILE= parameter to add clarity for non pinball users.  Its exectly the same as DIRECTOUTPUTCONFIG= but makes more sense if you can have COLOURS=Colours.ini  (and yes my North American friends, that's how you spell colour! :-) )

- New PIXELCADE_GAME_START_HIGHSCORE= parameter.  Determines if when a MAME game is started if high scores are shown in addition to the marquee
- NEW PIXELCADE_REPLACE_LED_MARQUEE_AFTER_ANIMATION= . Possibly the longest parameter name yet.  Used to choose if after an animation is shown on the LED display if the marquee is put back afterward.  Good to have set to 1 (yes) if you only have an LED display, but probably 0 (no) if you've got LCD and LED displays.
*** Note you need the DOFLinx MAME version 0.263 or later with DOFLinx V8 or later
- New ability for Popper to send menu event chages to DOFLinx so that MAME game names and high scores can be displayed on either the Pixelcade device or built in MAME score screen
  There is a guide on how to set this up
- Updated the built in DOFLinx MAME score screen to look a lot better
- New addition of in built SSF - thanks NailBuster for the push and start, TerryRed for a lot of info and contextualisation
- SSF 7.1 has been setup as standard for Pinball FX within the table.FX file, mainly the All_Pre.FX so far
  SSF can load multiple sounds for a named event then cycle through those sounds to achieve variety
  Volume, X, Y and Z coordinates are set per sound
  I am sure this is not perfect as I do not have a full 7.1 setup
- New SSF_ENABLED= 0 or 1 , 0 is the default being disabled, 1 is enabled
- New SSF_DEVICE= default is -1 being the default sound device
  For a differnt saound device simply get the Windows sounds device #, to help DOFLinx will list all available devices and their ID's at startup if you have DEBUG= set to 1 or 2
- New SSF_SOUND_PATH= this is the path where the necessary sound files are stored
  While you can set all of your own sounds if you want, DOFLinx is using Fleep sounds and they are in the \sounds folder of the standard installation ZIP

7.46 20/1/24
- Some minor PinOne message typos fixed
- Create x86 and x64 bit versions
  Remember you will need either the 32bit or 64 bit versions of DirectOutput.dll, B2SBackglassServer.dll and Extensions.dll all from DOF in the same folder as DOFLinx.EXE

7.45 1/6/23
- Add suport for PinOne output device.  Note you will need the DirectOutput.dll with PinOne added for a PinOne device to work

  0 = do not show, 1 = show
  This screen will show MAME scores, shots, hits and hit ratio.
  It can be dragged and resized to the required location. Double click to make it dragable and resizable, double click again to revert.  
  Screen, location and size will be saved upon closing DOFLinx.

- New, add MAME_FOCUS= parameter with a default of 1
  0 = do not try to focus the MAME process, 1 = do try to focus it - handy if you have a front end menu and sometimes manage to switch away from MAME (easily done with a light gun on a second screen)

7.33 14/5/21
- New, add FX3_TRIGGER_RELEASE_DELAY= parameter with a default of zero and able to set the number of milliseconds after a trigger in FX3 stops before the triggered action is recognised as stopped.
  Designed for use where the odd situation of false un-triggering occurs.
  A value of 50 should be enough, but it will delay the stop events, ie turning off a solenoid after the flipper key is lifted by 50mS
  Still testing this out to see if it does in fact help normal operation.  I have seen improvements in false launch ball triggering, logically this shouldn't happen, but then along came reality!

7.32 19/2/21
- Fix, the MAME player number in the static message on the DEBUG window for players >1
- New, added Green Beret MAME file, thanks denetor

- New, use the COLOUR_PALETTE= in FX3 files in preference to the GAME_COLOUR= in the base DOFLinx.INI file
  If you use the default colours shipped with DOFLinx then remove all GAME_COLOUR= lines from your DOFLinx.INI to clean it up
  If you have customised the colours in DOFLinx.INI then just leave those customised lines in there and they will be used
- New, add the setting of RGB button colours from within FX3 game files
- New, add BUTTON_LIGHT_ACTION= parameter.  Allows a button LED to be linked to triggers in the game file
  Lets the button light do things like pulse when the flipper or nudge is activated
- New, BUTTON_LIGHT_ACTION_ADDED= to add additional actions without clearing the list of button action
  BUTTON_LIGHT_ACTION= is used in the All_Pre file and BUTTON_LIGHT_ACTION_ADDED= adds to this list in the individual game file
- Update all FX3 files to drive RGB buttons should they be in use
- Include MAME 228

7.20 12/9/20
- Add analogue to digital nudge for FP
- Fix an error with Chime #3 working from FP.  Updated doflinx.vbs
- New screen to help create a basic DOFLinx.INI file
  This can be accessed via the right click menu when DEBUG is active, or, it will start automatically if no DOFLinx.INI exists.
- New, allow the PROCESSES= parameter to be adjusted while DOFLinx is running.
  This allows emulators to be added / subtracted from front end menus
- Added a new FX3 file for V2 of the IronMan FX3 backglass
  Now if you want to use the V1 backglass you will need to rename the IronMan V1 Backglass.FX3 to IronMax.FX3

7.16 21/7/20
- Fix, Running of XBox rumble from FP
- Fix, Move the code to load the doflinx ROM in DOF when starting FP to before the link is detected to speed things up a little.
- New, avoid reloading a ROM if its already loaded
- New, add parameter CLOSE_ROMS=1/0 (default =1)
  This allows you to determine of DOFLinx will close the ROM in DOF in between games
  For a pinball cabinet you will most likely want the default 1 = yes close them, which is the way it has always worked
  For an arcade cabinet when you are not having the front end run DOF events you may want to this as 0 = no don't close them.
  Given that all MAME files so far use the doflinx ROM it can easily be left open thus saving 5-10 seconds every load and providing more contunuity and ablity to easily use effects outside of when the emulator (MAME, Daphne, ePSX) is running.
- Suppress the loading of duplicate colours and modified colours from DirectOutputConfigxx.INI files

- Fix, add another couple of missing variables to the Show Variables funtion
- Updated version of MAME218

V7.10 7/3/20
- New, Add a default FX3 backglass called FX3Logo that will be displayed if FX3 doesn't have a currently active game name
  This occurs if you enter FX3 and use the menu without a game parsed as a parameter
- Add an error trapping layer around the call to the B2S server
- New, allow all standard parameters to be used in the [STARTUP] section of FX3 files
  This allows buttons to turned on, etc per game
- New, Add TRIGGER_DEBOUNCE_TIME= to optionally set the minimum amount of time in milliseconds between when a trigger can retrigger.
  Put in to help with FX3 fast retriggering, but applies to triggers no matter what emulator generates them.
  Default 200Ms
- Improved error checking for BUTTON_ONS= and BUTTONS_ON_COLOUR= parameters
- Depricate the BUTTONS_ON= and replace with FIXED_OUTPUTS=
- Depricate the BUTTONS_ON_COLOUR= and replace with FIXED_OUTPUTS_COLOUR=
  Both of the new formats above only accept D00, dropped these from accepting buttons.  Now use BUTTONS_LIT=

- New command OUTPUTS_OFF to allow all outputs to be turned off at any time.  Handy for when you exit your front end and want everything off as you go to the OS
- New way to define buttons and more button types.
  LINK_BUT_xx= allows the output port, output LED (mono or RGB colour), plus the input key code when the button is pressed to be defined
  Defining the input key code allows button alias (ie BUT_P1) to be used in configuration files like FX3 and MAME with one cetral definition of the key code
  Doing this ensures that scripts and game configuration files are fully portable
- A heap of new button definitions, LINK_BUT_xx where xx = RE,B1 - B8
- New, a shitload of stuff to make the MAME link work .... read the guide - its good!
- Inclusion of new folder in the release with a 64 bit compiled version of MAME that respondes to DOFLinx polling
- A new parameter for KEY_TO_COMMAND=
  This allows a key code to trigger a command setup in an FX3 or MAME file
  Very handy if you want to define something like your "Fire" button LINK_BUT_FR or LINK_BUT_1 to trigger a command each time its pressed, ie a dash on the addressable LED array
  Format is KEY_TO_COMMAND=bbb,cccc[,bbb,ccc] where bbb = BUT-1, BUT_ST, etc and ccc is an action you define in the FX3 or MAME file in the [COMMAND] section

  DOFLinx will warn if the DLL is missing or blocked and abort
- Add MAME as a trigger to DOFLinx actions
  Requires MAME > version 0.107 (when the network output was added), but only tested with 0.212
  In the mame.ini file within the "OSD Output Options" section set "output network"
- Add MAME_PROCESS= for this add your MAME emulator to the normal PROCESSES= line, but also add the MAME process to MAME_PROCESS=
  This enables DOFLinx to understand that this is your MAME emulator and to try and link to that when it causes DOFLinx to activate by being one of the processes in the PROCESSES= line
  Many people use differnt MAME emulators, so provided its > 0.107 and has the network output enabled all should be good
- Add PATH_MAME=, this is where the *.MAME files can be found, probably C:\DirectOutput\DOFLINX_MAME\
- Add MAME_TRIGGER_OUTPUT_PATH=, this doesn't have to be, but can be set, to provide an output file of all the triggers found in any MAME game that is run
  Setting this means that you can go back and find the triggers available for a given game and create a meaningful *.MAME file
  If a MAME game has no triggers then a blank file is saved in a subdirectory of this path called "NoTriggers" just so that you know
- Add *.MAME files to define parmeters, triggers and actions per MAME game
- Add LINK_P1, LINK_P2, LINK_PS (Player 1, Player 2, Pause)
- Add the ability for BUTTONS_ON= command to accept BUT_xx arguments as well as DOO numeric arguments
- ** CHANGED ** - The format of the LINK_xx for buttons has changed
  The format is now LINK_xx=D00,CCCC  where CCCC is the colour for a RGB button, or set to MONO or left blank for a single LED illuminated button
- Add COLOUR_PALETTE= where a list of colours can be set for the current palette in use for all RGB effects
  Most likely used in the STARTUP section of MAME files to set the colours for RGB devices
- Cut down the number of messages each time devices are activated, ie the X type Y devices found, only show those intialised
- Add the ability to view DEBUG information on another networked computer in real time via TCP connection
  Set DEBUG_TCP_PORT= to the port you wish to use, I suggest 8001
  Ideally place this parameter on the command line when you are starting DOFLinx, although it will also work if placed in DOFLinx.INI, just a little later after startup
  Setup something to monitor and read this port on your cabinet machine IP, I've written a small utility TCPReader.  You could use NC which is freely available
  The messages output on this port will be the same as those sent to DOFLinx.LOG
  Using DEBUG=2 and displaying debug information on a remote machine will stop you needing DOFLinx on a cabinet screen when debugging / monitoring
  Remember set DEBUG=0 when you are not chasing an issue, don't run it all the time
- ** CHANGED ** - Analogue plunger opertion for FX3
  The plunger key is pressed when the pull trigger point is reached then released when the plunger release point is reached
- Added a new parameter HOLD_ACTIVATION=1/0
  Used as a message via DOFLinxMsg or a vbs stcipt you may use to send messages to the DOFLinx pipe
  This will cause DOFLinx to stop any current processing and completely ignore any programs listed in your PROCESSES= list
  Essentially you can "pause" DOFLinx from activating
  It is the same as the right click option to "Stop Hold Restart"
- Improve the error checking for all LINK_xx= parameters to avoid errors with bad data in the configuration
  The parameter will not load, but will report as such if DEBUG= is set to other than 0
- Make the FP link checking 3X faster
- Add support for the FX3.EXE released for Halloween Monsters
- Add WMS Monster Bash and BALLY Creature from the Black Lagoon

- Make the right-click screens appear in the centre of the current monitor - I just got sick of dragging the damn things from monitor 1 to monitor 4!
- Fix error for Test Joystick and Test Output -> Input Loopback where it would crash if you have a SainSMart device or CLOSE_DEVICES_BETWEEN_ACTIVE=1 and have not pressed "Fake Emulation ON"
- Stop the Test Joystick option crashing if JOY_PORT= had not been set

- Reduce the FX3 nudge shaker action from 10 seconds to 4 seconds
- Rename the All.FX3 file to All_Pre.FX3 the functionality is the same, it still processes commands for all FX3 games before the table commands are loaded
- Add All_Post.FX3 for processing commands for all tables after the table commands are loaded
- Add a [CLEAR COMMANDS] section to the FX3 files to delete commands from the loaded set to allow for more detailed personalisation of settings
  Intended for use in the All_Post.FX3 file to remove unwanted effects
  Normally blank unless specific effects are desired
  So if you don't like any specific effects setup in the standard FX3 files you can remove it and optionally add your own
- Fix bug with analgue nudge where the ON effect for nudge was being incorrectly triggered again at nudge OFF resulting in flashers staying on and other devices running too long.

  Very handy to log details without impacting focus of windows while playing
  Also a bit faster because there are no screen updates in the DOFLinx window
- Make the joystick testing routine sample faster to get better results
- Add right click option to show key variables in debug window and to the LOG file

- Fix (again, or perhaps properly) the situation where registry X and Y positions saved for DOFLinx in debug mode could be silly values making it effectively invisible
- Fix a bug with the FF_COLOUR command for FX
  This will have stopped Undercab RGB working properly (or perhaps at all) for most people
- Add two new parameters for use in INI files
  FX2_FOCUS=1/0 - default =1
  FX3_FOCUS=1/0 - default =1
  Setting wither of the above to 0 (off) will make DOFLinx NOT try to refocus to FX2/3 after starting a B2S backglass
- FX3 files for Women of Power Champions, Guardians of the Galaxy, Darth Vader, Star Fighter Assault, The Walking Dead


V6.22 23/2/18

- Add detection of Teensy addressable LED controller
- Add test routine for any DOF configured ROM and element
- Tidy up some logging messages
- Add support for addressable LED commands from FX2 and FP

- Fix NightMode issue with the Settings menu where it did not start up correctly
- Tidied up the XBox failure message by removing the ugly looking detail of the error

V5.10 13/8/17
- Add support for XBox controllers
  Keys can now be defined as per previous with keycodes, or starting with X for XBox, then the number of the controller, then the key code
  ie X1LS is Xbox controller 1 Left Shoulder button.
  Valid buttons are DU, DD, DL, DR, ST, BK, LT, RT, LS, RS, A, B, X, Y
- Fix minor button size / text issue on main screen
- Add new command line parameter of FTDI=
  Setting this to NO stops the checking for FTDI devices.  Beneficial if you have non-pinball based FTDI devices connected

- Save the position and size upon exit and restart in the same spot and size next time
- Allow DOFLinx to run without having L_FLIPPER_OUTPUT and R_FLIPPER_OUTPUT defined
- Improve handling of memory read when waiting for FP link to establish
- Pinscape controllers are now detected as Pinscape controllers.  If you have LEDWiz emulation they will also detect as LEDWiz devices making it look like you have two devices.
  Use the Pinscape controller as the PWM divisions are far more accurate, ie 255 divisions as opposed to 49.
  One day I'll find out how to tell a real LEDWiz from an emulated one and suppress the emulated one.
  You will need to have the Pinscape capable version of DOF R3 from mjr loaded for Pinscape controllers to work
  If you decide to stick with the non Pinscape DOF R3 Framework then simply add PINSCAPE=NO to the command line when you start DOFLinx otherwise you will get a .NET framework error
- DOFLinx now writes some settings to the registry
  This is mentioned just in case you strike security issues with the registry and the user you are running DOFLinx under
  Ideally you would have DOFLinx set to run as administrator
- New parameter PATH_FX2_B2S= This is the location of any FX2 B2S files
  Default will be the executing directory
- New parameter PATH_B2S_SERVER= This is the location of the B2SServerEXE.exe on your machine
  Default is C:\VP\
- Fix issue where the log file could drift into another folder as opposed to the one where DOFLix starts
- Add new command for FX2 being FF_B2S
  Used to command the B2S backglass for the FX2 game, ie "FF_B2S B2SSetData 2,1" to turn on lamp #2
  Valid B2S commands are B2SSetData, B2SStartAnimation, B2SStartAnimationReverse, B2SStopAnimation, B2SStapAllAnimations
- Improve the timing of the process activation detection
- Add detection of Ultimate I/O board for outputs
- Add a new command KILL=xxx to stop another pocess on your cabinet
  ie send a message on exiting PinballFX2 to ensure its closed via launch after in PinballX
  DOFLinxMsg "KILL=Pinball FX2"  (The double quotes are only required due to the space in the name
- Fix Test Device and Test RGB where trying to go beyond the number of devices you have connected would cause a dot net error

V4.30 4/6/17
- Add the ability to set the intensity (0 - 255) for LINK_XX devices (LF, RF, LS, RS, ML, MC, MR, BL, BC, BR, SH, GR, KN, FN, SR, BK)
  This change introduces a new format for all of the LINK_XX commands in the line above.  Each of those lines in your DOFLinx.INI will require updating.
  To retain functionality exactly as it was in previous versions just add ",255" (without the quotes) to each LINK_XX line where XX is in the above group.
  Note, not all LINK_XX lines are changing, only those listed above.

V4.23 3/5/17

- Improved FX2 files for The Avengers, Bob's Burgers, Age of Ultron, Archer and Civil War to mirror flashers

V4.10 27/11/16
- Add additional debug message to report details on the FX2 executable file
  Help to give an indication if a person having difficulties is actually running the Steam version or not
- Add a new mode to FX2 memory mapped files of SCOREMODE, this allows for devices to be turned off once a game is complete and entry of scores is being wait on
- New FX2 files SouthPark1 and 2, Aliens, Aliens v Predator, Alien Isolation
  All of these new FX2 files are more advanced than previous ones.  They mirror flashers from the game instead of using timers ... its the way of the future!

V4.05B 20/11/16
- New FX2 files, Super League (soccer) and Guardians of the Galaxy

V4.05 13/11/16
- Remove duplicit log message when loading FX2 memory map file
- Add milliseconds to the LOG time
- Add the facility for a "default.fx2" memory map file
  This allows for better flipper operation, ball launch, some flashers - essentially a bit more than just the basics for those tables not mapped yet
- New FX2 files, Fear ItSelf, Plants Vs Zombies, Civil War, Castle Storm, DeadPool

Still V4.04 11/11/16
- New FX2 files, Avengers Age of Ultron, The Avengers
- Fix Age of Ultron GAME_NAME= in the sample DOFLinx.INI
- Add a commented out FP_LINK_WAIT_TIME= to the default DOFLinx.INI file for easy editing by those with link timeout issues

V4.04 7/11/16
- Make flasher fading smoother by not updating the controlling device as often
- New FX2 files, The Walking Dead, Sorcerer's Lair

V4.03 6/11/16
- Additional message to show when a flasher is sent an invalid colour from FP
- Improved process of checking for FP link to use less CPU and reduce end of memory errors

V4.01 24/10/16
- Additional debug logging around process discovery and activation
- Improve port parameter checking so that RGB based devices can only be set to the devices maximum ports -2 to avoid errors with port +1 for Greeen and port +2 for Blue
- Make the wait for FX2 window activation, and hence game name more robust

V4.0 22/10/16
- Add support for full DOF with Pinball FX2
- Add parameter for PATH_INI= being the default path for INI files
  The path can be absolute C:\DOFLinx\INI\ or relative from where the program is located DOFLinx_INI\
  The path needs to end with a backslash \
  This is also a command line parameter allowing the default DOFLinx.INI to also be placed in the PATH_INI folder
- Add parameter for PATH_FX2= being the default path for FX2 configuration files
  The path can be absolute C:\DOFLinx\FX2\ or relative from where the program is located DOFLinx_FX2\
  The path needs to end with a backslash \
- Add parameter FP_LINK_WAIT_TIME= to configure how long DOFLinx waits from process detection until giving up looking for a FP table running DOFLinx code
  The default is 40 seconds (was 30 seconds prior to V4), which should be enough.
  You can make it shorter or longer then the default in milliseconds (default is 40000)
- Before opening up the test device or test RGB / flasher screens check that output devices are available to avoid a horrible mess
- Add support for memory mapped FX2 triggers
  Thanks to gigalula for inspiration, encouragement and talking about this with me when my intial idea hit problems - I hope your project continues to do well too
  A setup file for each table can be stored in the PATH_FX2 folder, or the default EXE directory if you prefer (set the folder path, its neater!)
  Read the guide about how to edit, or even create these setup files
- FX2 game names automatically found from window titles now have no charaters other than numbers aand letters, ie 0-9 A-Z a-z
  This will require editing out the character;    space ! , . : ' -      from Game Names in your INI file
  Sorry for the change, but in using the Game Name for FX2 disk files some of the extra characters are not allowed, others are a PITA
  You can cut and paste a replacement for the Game Colours setup by Vizzini into your own INI from the supplied default INI
  I've edited the names in the supplied default DOFLinx.INI

V3.05 27/9/16
- Fix bug where RANDOM as a colour was not working correctly for FL_FD and FL_FL based flasher commands from FP script
- Include missing command instructions for KEY_TO_COLOUR_TIMER and KEY_TO_OUTPUT_TIMER in the guide

V3.03 
- Fix fading for LED button abd flashers from FP table link with low fade times

V3.02 20/9/16
- Added check that the DOFLinx process has administrator rights when trying to link to a FP coded table
  DOFLinx will not attempt to link if it does not have sufficient rights
- Added more checks and logging around the type of FP process, FP version, etc
- Added FF_FlasherForMs command for FP scripting.  Ensure DOFLinx.vbs in 'Future Pinball\Scripts' is replaced
- Fixed bug whereby the FP Link establishment could miss the end of memory when modified FP versions are in use

V3.0 13/9/16
Change name to DOFLinx
- Add a link with FP to allow FP to send messages and use a reasonable level of DOF
  New parameter FP_ATTEMPT_LINK=  1 for on, 0 for off, default is off.
  Setting this parameter will cause DOFLinx to try and link to a FP DOF'ed table.  The table must be coded to support this.
  New parameters (LINK_ ) to setup devices and buttons for FP.  Read the guide to set them all.
- Add parameter CLOSE_DEVICES_BETWEEN_ACTIVE=
  Can be set to 1 to turn on.  Default is off.
  When set this will cause DOFLinx to close the devices and re-open when it activates again.  This action occurs automatically for SainSmart devices - you can't change that.
  This is only for specific use when there is interference between running programs using DOF.  Don't set this for fun.
- A new option for RGB_STYLE= is now RANDOM_DIFF.  This will display a random colour on each RGB output device listed (have fun GInsonic)
- Fix bug where KEY_TO_COLOUR_TIMER would override and stuff up KEY_TO_COLOUR_TOGGLE
- Fix bug where LedWiz devices with higher numbers (and the KL25Z - device #8) would not work properly.
- Add the ability to process GAME_NAME as a message
- Allow the special colour name of "Random" for colour based operations.
  It will display a random colour from the currently active palette.
- Make the window resizable to allow better veiwing of messages
- Fix issue caused by FX2 having non printable characters in the window name and therefore not matching GAME_GOLOUR= names
- Add BUTTON_ON_COLOUR=DOO,CCCCC to turn on RGB button LEDs to the selected colour.  The RGB equivalent of BUTTON_ON=
- Add parameter NIGHT_MODE=1/0, this will disable noise making devices for night time operation.

V2.0 18/8/16
- !!!! LOOK HERE !!!! ---->>>> Change all parameter lists in the INI file from space to comma separated
- Lots of improvements to memory handling
- Convert arrays to lists, thus removing limits like 10 processes and 50 keys
- Remove some remaining additional logging messages from PacLed64 testing
- Add INI parameter KEY_TO_OUTPUT_TIMER=KK,DOO,MMMM,KK,DOO,MMMM   where MMMM=time to keep the ouput on in milliseconds
  This allows you to turn on the output, ie shaker, button LED, blower for a set time when a key is pressed for MMMM milliseconds
  Nice for adding a bit of shake when you press the nudge keys
- Add INI parameter KEY_TO_COLOUR_TIMER=KK,DOO,CCCC,MMMM,KK,DOO,CCCC,MMMM   where MMMM=time to keep the ouput on in milliseconds
  This will set your RGB to colour CCCC for MMMM millisends.
  RGB_OUTPUT colours will be suspended for this output during MMMM.
  The RGB output will revert to the current RGB_OUT colour after MMMM time has passed.  This is the same behaviour as KEY_TO_COLOUR_TOGGLE
- Add the ability to send DOFFX2 interprocess messages while running to change many parameters and issue immediate commands
  The new immediate commands are:
  QUIT - this gets DOFFX2 to stop operationa nd exit straight away
  GAME_FLAG_FILE=PPP\FFFF - where PPP is the path and FFFF is the file name with no extension.  See usage below
  OUTPUT_NOW_TIMER=DOO,MMMM,DOO,MMMM, etc - this turns on device / output DOO for MMMM milliseconds
  (Nb.  this will not work for a SainSmart controller unless DOFFX2 is "awake" via a valid process running or FORCE_ACTIVE=1 given that the controller board can only have one master at a time)
  COLOUR_NOW_TIMER=DOO,MMMM,CCCC,DOO,MMMM,CCCC - this turns RGB device with RED at device / output DOO to colour CCCC for MMMM milliseconds
  Messages can be sent to DOFFX2 with the utility program DOFFX2Msg in the format
  DOFFX2Msg OUTPUT_NOW_TIMER=DOO,MMMM,CCCC#COLOUR_NOW_TIMER=DOO,MMMM,CCCC  - multiple commands are separated by a #  character
- Add the GAME_FLAG_FILE=PPP\FFFF immediate parameter, PPP is the full path, FFF is the file name with no extension, ie C:\VP\TABLES\SomeTableName
  If the FFFF file, with an extension of ".DOFFX2" exists, then DOFFX2 will activate.  (you must also have the process in the PROCESSES list)
  Why, well if you provide the GAME_FILE_NAME= as a run before in PinballX, "DOFFX2Msg GAME_FILE_NAME=[TABLEPATH]\[TABLENAME]", then if you add a file (who cares how big or what's in it) in the VP tables folder with same name as your game (and possibly B2S file), but with extension ".DOFFX2", then DOFFX2 will activate for that table only.
  This allows you to add an emulator that has DOF tables to the DOFFX2 process list, but only have DOFFX2 activate for the tables you specifiy via the flag file.
  As such, you can have 90% of your tables running with built in DOF, and falg the ones with no DOF to get the flippers and RGB from DOFFX2.  Now 100% of your tables have DOF of some sort.
  If you set the GAME_FLAG_FILE=PPPP\FFFF as a 'Launch Before' then you will have to do a run after of "DOFFX2Msg GAME_NAME=" to 'unset' the name.  If you don't do this then you might acidentally force DOFFX2 to run on a table you don't want it to.  This shouldn't happen if you 'Launch Before' on each table, but it can theoretically happen if the next table you launch is in another emulator that you haven't setup this way, so best to cleanup.
- Allow SUP_INI= files to be processed during run-time via a message.
  For most commands, ie key reconfigurations, DOFFX2 must be be asleep.
- Fix bug where not all LedWiz devices were always found

V1.4 4/8/16
- Added PacLed64 support
  If you have PacLed64(s), on the command line add "PACLED64=1" or "PACLED64=1,2" or "PACLED64=1,2,3,4", etc.  
  Just include the numbers of the PacLed64 devices you have (their ID number), if you only have one device its probably "PACLED64=1"  (all with no quotes of course)
  I've had to have this type of driver board defined on the command line as I can't figure out how to test for PacLed64 existence automatically without using the PacDrive SDK ontop of the DOF framework.
- Fix bug whereby a GAME_COLOUR list with one colour would crash
- Increase KEY_TO_OUTPUT sets to 50
- Increase KEY_TO_COLOUR sets to 50
- Add three command line parameters ....
- 1) PACLED64= (as per above)
- 2) GAME_NAME=XXX this forces the game name to this value, hence you can get a game specific colour set to work regardless of the auto detection working.
  Auto detection of game name works for Pinball FX2 when started with the [TABLEFILE] parameter from the likes of PinballX menu.
- 3) SUP_INI= you can provide a supplementary INI file.  DOFFX2.ini will always be processed first with the supplementary file second.
  This allows for emulator or game specific settings to be placed here.
  So when starting DOFFX2 as a "Launch Before" program you can add a specific configuration file, ie DOFFX2 SUP_INI=FuturePinball or DOFFX2 SUP_INI=[TABLEFILE]
  This will allow for Table specific configurations.
- Added INI parameter PROCESSES=
  This allows up to 10 process names to be supplied in a comma separated list that can "wake up" DOFFX2
  If the line is ommitted or commented out the default process is "Pinball FX2".
  If you add the line and want Pinball FX2 to funstion you must add it yourself.
  A line could look like (note bogus process names) PROCESSES=Pinball FX2,FP,TPA,Some Process,ETC
  The process names are as they appear in Task Manager.  Happy to include some examples here if people send them to me.
- Fix the default MAX_FLIPPER_ON time

V1.3 31/7/16
- Make DOFFX2 check for the Pinball FX2 process more frequently when it knows PinBall FX2 is running so that exit and shutdown delay is less.
- Added INI parameter OUTPUT_GAME_NAME=  0 or 1 (default 0).  Setting this to 1 means that the detected game name will be output to the log file regardless of the DEBUG flag
  This is useful when trying to setup colours for each game to ensure you have the exact game name from the FX2 window.
- Fix bug whereby >5 KEY_TO_OUTPUT would break the count of key to output pairs and cause a non-crash error.
- Fix bug whereby >10 KEY_TO_OUTPUT pairs in the INI file would crash.
- Extended KEY_TO_OUTPUT to 20 pairs.
- New parameter FORCE_ACTIVE= 0 or 1 (default 0).  This forces DOFFX2 to be active from the moment it starts until you kill the process.
  A little something for TerryRed to play with and use the utility for more than just Pinball FX2
- Add additional error checks for some parameters when reading the INI file.
- Fix bug with MAX_FLIPPER_ON whereby it would turn the flipper solenoid off but then go immediately back on if the key was still pressed.
  Now the flipper key needs to be re-pressed.
- Added INI parameter KEY_TO_COLOUR= to have a key press set an RGB colour.
  The format is "KEY_TO_COLOUR=KK DOO The_Colour KK DOO The_Colour" with upto 20 keys.  The keys are still https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
  The DOO is the same as for RGB_OUTPUT= being the RED device / port.  The_Colour is a valid colour name in your directoutputconfig file.
- Added INI parameter GAME_COLOUR=Game Name,Colour#1,Colour#2,etc (upto a shit load of colours)
  Make sure the first item on this CSV list is the FX2 game name with no quotes
  If you don't set a specific set of colours for a game then the full palette is used
  The Game Name is the name FX2 adds to the PinBall FX2 window.
  If in doubt run DOFFX2 in DEBUG or set OUTPUT_GAME_NAME=1 to force the detected game name to be written to the log file.
  Note - The Game Name does not have to be the same as the Table name parsed by PinballX to Steam.  It is usually the "Friendly" / "Marketting" name.

V1.2 26/7/16
- Add FTDI (Sainsmart) support - thanks Doogie2301 for your testing and feedback
- QUIT_AFTER_FX2=0 or 1 (default 0)
  If this is set to 1, then DOFFX2 will close completely after Pinball FX2 stops.
  This allows for DOFFX2 to be started as a "Run Before" program without the need to kill the process afterwards.
  It ensures the program exits cleanly (as opposed to sending it a "kill" signal).
  There is no need to use this as DOFFX2 is designed to run continuously in the background, however, if you prefer to start and stop it each time - feel free.
- Standardise a number of DOF.Output structures from LEDWiz to common interfaces
- Initialise the DOF devices before reading the config file allowing checking of devices and ports
- Add a lot of error checking for devices, ports, etc.

V1.1 24/7/16
- KEY_TO_OUTPUT=KK DOO KK DOO
  When KK key is pressed LEDWiz output D OO is activated.  When the key is lifted the output is turned off
  This will allow a key not used in FX2, to trigger a LEDWiz output while the key is pressed.
  For example assign key 1 (Start) to trigger an output, the output can run a relay to trigger a keyboard emulator key, ie iPac.
  Why, well this alows the <Start> key (4) to essentially press another key like <ENTER> on the keyboard.  Effectively this gives you two <ENTER> keys for FX2.
  So now you can use the <Start> button for starting a game and locking in initials for scores instead of haing to pull the plunger all the time.
  The other key this is a candidate for is to "remap" the <Coin> key (4) to the "C" key.
  This allows the unused <Coin> button in FX2 to adjust the camera.
  Of course you could use this to simply turn on the button LED for an unused key just to make everything seem interactive.
  Upto 10 KK DOO sets can be entered
  A key can appear twice, this allows one key to turn on/off multiple DOF outputs, so you could turn on the buttons LED and a relay if you want
- Ensure the colours start straight away when using flippers as the trigger
- Detect the game name being played (future use for a colour by game idea)

V1.0 22/7/16
Initial release
